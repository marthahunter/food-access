#### 🥫 Executive Summary:
Food insecurity, put simply by [Feeding America](https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/food-insecurity), is “When people don't have enough to eat … [or] know where their next meal will come from.” Dealing with hunger can affect many aspects of a person’s wellbeing, beyond simply physical health. This project aims to examine income and other key issues communities with higher rates of food insecurity experience.
